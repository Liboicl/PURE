* Writing Plugins
	Todo
	Feel free to look at the already wrote plugins and work form those.
	I plan on writing a formal tutorial explaining them in a bit more 
	detail.
	
* Code Format
	Todo
	I plan to define certain guidelines to keep the project consistent. For
	now, please try to follow the previous code style. Code clean up is in
	order as well.
	
* Todo`s
	This is an incomplete list of planned features. If you wish to 
	contribute, this is a great place to start. They are roughly organized
	based on difficulty.
	
	%Easy%
	- Better error handling on plugin loading, including ignoring missing
	  info that is optional.
	
	%Moderate%
	- Write Manuals for Plugin Writing & Code Formatting.
	- Implement the PS3 plugin as an "official" Sony product.
	- Write a helper library for plugins to handle basic repetitive tasks,
	  such as receiving input.
	- Add more to configuration file, including key mapping. Likely define
	  all keys in a header with user friendly names.
	
	%Difficult%
	- Allow multiple plugins at once; This will require a good amount of
	  code rewriting.
